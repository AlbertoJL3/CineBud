# RecMe
This repo is for making a movie-recommendation system that leverages ML/AI tools combined with React and Node.js to deliver movie recommendations based on the user's ratings of movies. 

## Project Overview: RecMe

Objective: To provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and ratings.
## User Requirements:

    Account Creation and Management: Users should be able to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
    Movie Browsing: Users can browse a catalog of movies.
    Rating System: Users can rate movies they have watched.
    Personalized Recommendations: Users receive movie recommendations based on their ratings and preferences.
    Search and Filtering: Users can search for movies and filter by tags like genre, actors, directors, etc.
    User Feedback: Users can provide feedback on recommendations (e.g., helpful, not helpful).

## Technical Structure:
1. Frontend (React):

    User Interface: A sleek, responsive UI for account management, browsing movies, rating, and receiving recommendations.
    Interactivity: Handles user inputs like ratings, search queries, and feedback.
    Communication with Backend: Sends and retrieves data to/from the Node.js server using RESTful API or GraphQL.

2. Backend Server (Node.js):

    API Layer: Manages API requests from the frontend.
    User Authentication and Authorization: Handles user accounts, authentication, and session management.
    Data Forwarding: Sends user data and movie ratings to the Python backend for processing and retrieves recommendations.

3. Backend Processing (Python):

    Machine Learning Model: A recommendation system built using Python with libraries like Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
    Data Analysis and Processing: Analyzes user ratings and preferences.
    Database Interaction: Communicates with the database to store and retrieve user data, movie information, ratings, etc.

4. Database:

    User Data: Stores user profiles, authentication data, and preferences.
    Movie Data: Contains movie details including tags like genre, actors, directors.
    Ratings and Feedback: Keeps track of user ratings and feedback on recommendations.

5. Machine Learning Model:

    Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on ratings from similar users.
    Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies similar to those the user has rated highly (based on tags like genre, actors, etc.).
    Hybrid Approach: Combines both methods for more accurate recommendations.

## Data Flow:

    User Interaction: User rates movies and sets preferences on the React frontend.
    Data Transmission: This data is sent to the Node.js backend.
    Processing Request: Node.js forwards this data to the Python service.
    Machine Learning Processing: Python service processes the data, updates the model, and generates recommendations.
    Sending Back Recommendations: Recommendations are sent back to Node.js, which then forwards them to the React frontend for the user to view.

## Additional Considerations:

    Scalability: Ensure the system can handle a growing number of users and data.
    Security: Implement strong security measures for user data and authentication.
    User Experience: Design an intuitive and engaging interface.
    Data Privacy: Adhere to data protection regulations and best practices.
